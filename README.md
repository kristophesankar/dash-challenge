- I took a look at the linked repository and the related example.
- I thought the example seemed a bit dated so I created a new project to take advantage of some of React's newer features.
- Notes on version of React. Due to old version of react that React Calendar Timeline uses. I may have to switch to a more suitable version.
    - of the warnings presented, 'componentWillReceiveProps has been renamed' leads me to think that I should switch to a version that supports this.
